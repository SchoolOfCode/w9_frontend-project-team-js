# Backpack - from Team.js

## Introduction

Backpack is an app that aims to support students learning to code - or learning any skill for that matter!

The general premise of the app is to help students to keep track of their development, by breaking down the topics into individual skills, as well as tools to assist in improving those skills.

This is currently the MVP for Backpack, V.1.0, and future releases will aim to include functionality such as:

- connecting with friends
- mental health support
- flashcard revision
- resource library
- user login and authentication
